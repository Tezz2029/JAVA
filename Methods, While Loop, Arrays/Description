# Java Methods, While Loop, and Arrays

This folder contains Java programs that demonstrate core concepts related to:

- **Java Methods**: Programs showcasing method creation, overloading, and invocation, focusing on reusable code and modular programming techniques.
- **While Loop**: Iterative logic using `while` loops, including examples of controlling flow and handling different loop scenarios like infinite and conditional loops.
- **Arrays**: Implementations of single and multi-dimensional arrays, illustrating array initialization, traversal, manipulation, and common operations like searching and sorting.

These programs form a crucial part of my understanding of iterative structures, data handling, and method-driven design in Java.
